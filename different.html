    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel poses the question "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" A correct answer to the question is a "secret" — a piece of unpopular/unconventional truth.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The same concept applies toward investing. If everyone looks at a company with a similar narrative, they arrive at a similar opinion. There is also always a case to be made for conservatism. We are too afraid of differing from the crowd and looking foolish that we ignore the low-probability, tail-end outcomes that create positive expected value bets. Therefore, I believe to generate great returns we need a differentiated, idiosyncratic way of valuing companies and looking at the world. We need to find the secret that explains anomalies, one that breaks the efficient market theory.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I don't think I will find this secret by studying finance but rather find it somewhere in the humanities. Philosophy is an interesting field because we learn about independent thinkers in the past who suggested new ways of understanding the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Another way to find secrets is through first principles thinking, to reason from fundamental truths rather than blindly accept beliefs held by most people. I find discounted cash flow models fall into the category of a popular belief I accepted without thinking about if it is a good way of valuing a business.&nbsp;</p>
