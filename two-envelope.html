    <p>There are two envelopes on the table. You are told that one of them contains double the amount of money as the other. Say you open one and find $20, the other envelope therefore has either $10 or $40. The question is would you swap your envelope for
        the other one on the table. <br></p>
    <p>Since it is equally likely that you picked the envelope with less money or more money, there should be a 50% chance of $10 in the other envelope and a 50% chance of $40. The expected value of the other envelope is 0.5*10 + 0.5*40 = 25, which is larger
        than the 20 you have on hand. You should switch. But this conclusion seems to always apply. No matter what amount you find in the first envelope you picked, it seems like you should always swap for the other. But how can your first choice always
        be worse than the other envelope? This is the two-envelope paradox.</p>
    <p>I would like to demonstrate that the two envelopes are equal because of the risk involved in the trade by applying the concept of the Kelly bet, which was popularized by blackjack card counters and later applied in investment management.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Let's look at the problem a different way. You walk into a casino with $20 dollars in your pocket. You are offered this bet that have 2-1 odds, but you have to bet half of your money. Betting half of your money in this case is $10, 2-1 odds means
        when you win, you get $20 on top of your original bet of $10, which lands you at $40. If you lose, you lose the $10 you bet, which puts you back to $10.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The decision to swap can be thought of as "is it a good idea to take a bet with 2-1 odds with half of your money with a 50/50 chance?"&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You might say "Of course! The expected value is positive as the math before had shown." But think about this: you walk into the casino with $1 million, or your entire savings, and you were offered this bet, would you still take the bet? You probably
        wouldn't. The risk seems daunting.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The $20 in the first example was arbitrary. The point of the problem is to maximize the resulting bankroll no matter the starting amount. The fact is, you should think of the problem as betting your whole net worth for a 50/50 chance of halving or
        doubling, since the amount in the first envelope should represent your entire wealth, the object you are trying to maximize.&nbsp;</p>
