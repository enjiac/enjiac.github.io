    <h1 style="padding-top: 40px;padding-right: 36px;">Great Movies</h1>
    <p>I get excited and emotional after I see a great movie. I would scour youtube for videos where people analyze what the movie got right and dissect the metaphors. </p>
    <p>I like that the medium of film is approachable and has mass appeal. <br>While most people could not appreciate paintings in art museums, great movies seem to resonate with the masses. But at the same time, people leave with their own interpretations
        in relation with their own lives.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite movies:</p>
    <h2 class="movietitle">Inception</h2><img class="moviepic" src="assets/img/incep.PNG" style="/*width: 100%;*/">
    <p>Inception is at the top of my list of great movies. To me, the sharing of dreams is such a brilliant concept. Because the movie didn't have an overly sci-fi theme, it seemed almost realistic.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Despite the overarching dream hacking, action-driven mission, the central plot of the movie is really about the internal conflict of Cobb who has to come to terms with the death of his wife. During the mission we see glimpses and hints of their tragic
        story. At the climax, Cobb, with all of his love and guilt, had to make the choice between his wife in the dream world and his children in reality.&nbsp;It's something that most action movies miss. They lack a strong character arc like that of
        Cobb. <br></p>
    <p>What boggled my mind was when someone pointed out that the concept of sharing dreams is actually a metaphor for film itself. In a movie theatre, the lights dim, and the audience shares a vision created by the director. Nolan saw himself as Cobb, who
        is the architect building out all these elaborate dream worlds and narratives. Just like making a movie, people with different skills come together as a team (the actor, the production design, the writer, and the studio exec) to bring the director's
        vision to the audience.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>A film, like dreams in the movie, therefore is a sandbox for people to build a world and tell a story. The creative freedom falls in the hands of the director as he brings people into his dreams.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <h2 class="movietitle">The Before Trilogy</h2><img class="moviepic" src="assets/img/Capture3.PNG" style="width: 90%;">
    <p>This is a trilogy about a romance made 9 years apart from each other. The movies take us on a journey from the boy and the girl who met on a train to a couple in marriage 18 years later. The coolest part is to see the actor and actress grow up in
        the different movies. It feels like time travel, their lives flashing before your eyes.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>The movies are mainly made up of dialogues between the two. I liked that a lot. It felt relatable and authentic. The conversations are so natural it's just like two old friends catching up. It may seem to lack drama and an exciting plot to follow.
        But between the lines, the characters show their personalities and subtly reveal their desires.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>As they walk, they contemplate topics such as romance, youth, religion, and death. Boy and girl who have different backgrounds find their world-views collide. Yet a definite connection forms. There is something beautiful about two people connecting,
        talking about the different ways they see things, and figuring out life together. Maybe that's what relationships should be like. <br></p>
    <p>A youtube comment suggested alternative titles for the three movies:<br>"What it could be"<br>"What it should be"<br>"What it is"&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Before sunrise portrays an idealistic yet ephemeral romance between two young people who met on a train.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Before sunset revisits the two who have been through relationships of their own and contemplates the role of love and romantic connection in these committed relationships.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Before midnight reflects on the imperfect reality of a marriage -- the lashing out, the painful words, and the attempts to keep the flame alive.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>I often think about relationships -- what I want from one, what love is, romance vs "partnership," and the whole idea of being with someone for the rest of my life. I think the movies gave me perspective and helped me find my own answers to the questions.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Director Richard Linklater thought of the movies as a mirror, where everyone takes away different things from where they are in their lives. This is possible because the movies portray something inexplicably human -- a search for connection, from
        the first time you meet the person to the arguments in your marriage. In the end, don't we all just want to be loved a little more?&nbsp;<br></p>
