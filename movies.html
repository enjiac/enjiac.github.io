    <h1 style="padding-left: 36px;padding-top: 40px;padding-right: 36px;">Great Movies</h1>
    <p>I get excited and emotional after I see a great movie. I would scour youtube for videos where people analyze what the movie got right and dissect the metaphors. </p>
    <p>I like that the medium of film is approachable and has mass appeal. <br>While most people could not appreciate paintings in art museums, great movies seem to resonate with the masses. But at the same time, people leave with their own interpretations
        related with their lives.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite movies:</p>
    <h2 style="padding-left: 36px;">Inception</h2><img src="assets/img/incep.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>Inception is at the top of my list of great movies. To me, the sharing of dreams is such a brilliant concept. Because the movie didn't have an overly sci-fi theme, it seemed almost realistic.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>On top of the exciting idea, the film delivers a great story. Despite the overarching dream hacking, action-driven mission, the central plot of the movie is really about the internal conflict of Cobb who has to come to terms with the death of his
        wife. During the mission we see glimpses and hints of their tragic story. At the climax, Cobb, with all of his love and guilt, had to make the choice between his wife in the dream world and his children in reality.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>What boggled my mind was when someone pointed out that the concept of sharing dreams is actually a metaphor for film itself. In a movie theatre, the lights dim, and the audience shares a vision created by the director. Nolan saw himself as Cobb, who
        is the architect building out all these elaborate dream worlds and narratives. Just like making a movie, people with different skills come together as a team (the actor, the production design, the writer, and the studio exec) to bring the director's
        vision to the audience.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>A film, like dreams in the movie, therefore is a sandbox for people to build a world and tell a story. The creative freedom falls in the hands of the director as he brings people into his dreams.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <h2 style="padding-left: 36px;">The Before Trilogy</h2><img src="assets/img/Capture3.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>This is a trilogy about a romance made 9 years apart from each other. The movies take us on a journey from the boy and the girl who met on a train to a couple in marriage 18 years later. The coolest part was to see the actor and actress grow up in
        the different movies. It felt like time travel, their lives flashing before your eyes.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>The movies were mainly made up of dialogues between the two, which is an aspect I particularly enjoyed. It may seem to lack drama and an exciting plot to follow. But between the lines, the characters show their personalities and subtly reveal their
        desires. The dialogues were so natural and realistic it felt like two old friends catching up.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Within the conversations, topics such as romance, youth, religion, and death came up. Boy and girl who have different backgrounds find their world-views collide. The idea of two people figuring out life together, talking about the different ways they
        see things is the kind of relationship I would like to have.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>A youtube comment suggested alternative titles for the three movies:<br>"What it could be"<br>"What it should be"<br>"What it is"&nbsp;<br></p>
