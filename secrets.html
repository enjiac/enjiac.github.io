    <h2 class="movietitle" style="padding-top: 40px;padding-right: 36px;">Finding Secrets</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel poses the question "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" A correct answer to the question is a "secret" — a piece of unpopular/unconventional truth.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">We can apply this concept of secrets toward investing. If everyone looks at a company with a similar narrative, they arrive at a similar opinion. There is also always a case to be made for conservatism. We are too afraid of differing from the crowd and looking foolish that we ignore the low-probability, tail-end outcomes that create positive expected value bets. It's easy to buy FAANG, Tencent, Microsoft, these investments are commonly agreed upon, but it is precisely because of this that these companies will not provide outsized returns. Therefore, I believe to generate great returns we need a differentiated, idiosyncratic way of valuing companies and looking at the world. We need to find the secret that explains anomalies, one that breaks the efficient market theory.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I don't think I will find this secret by studying finance but rather find it somewhere in the humanities. Philosophy is an interesting field because we learn about independent thinkers in the past who suggested new ways of understanding the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Another way to find secrets is through first principles thinking, to reason from fundamental truths rather than blindly accept beliefs held by most people. I find discounted cash flow models fall into the category of a popular belief I accepted without thinking about if it is a good way of valuing a business.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3 class="movietitle" style="margin-top: 20px;">Terminal Value and Facebook</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">DCF's often project earnings indefinitely in its terminal value. However, companies don't last forever. I would argue that most DCF's overestimate the intrinsic value of a company because of that. In addition, the expected lifetime of a company cannot be the same for all firms. Facebook grew quickly because of its network effects, but network effects also mean when people leave, people leave in droves. Accounts I follow on Twitter often compare the valuations between the S&amp;P 500 with Facebook and Google, citing that they trade on similar multiples but the latter are growing twice as fast. However, FB at least has clear risk in its terminal value. Facebook is unlikely to continue its dominance for the next 10 years as users are shifting elsewhere. Casting aside the main Facebook platform, users also report Instagram as dying, and I clearly see usage in my age group decline. The economic moat of network effect is insufficient when consumers experience a decline in their need for social media engagement on the same platform. Instagram was a hot toy to get social validation when it was popular. It may not be clear right now since Facebook and Instagram are the first products to introduce social media to a massive scale, but consumers pursue the next hot thing. The intricacies of social validation is not tied to the platform itself and can shift like the futile winds of fashion. Unlike enterprise products with sticky users, consumers are finicky and agile. A product loses its coolness just slightly, little by little, but then all at once as the network effect unwinds. Compared to companies in sectors where we see less change and disruption, I could make the case that Facebook is not going to make its current earnings for decades to come. Since the terminal value makes up a large chunk of value of a company as interest rates are low, maybe the lower valuation is justified.&nbsp;</p>
