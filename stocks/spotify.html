    <p style="text-align: end;">08/10/2020<br></p>
    <p>I have a bullish view on Spotify. Starting off with my overall tech thesis, I believe tech to be often undervalued because the market does not foresee future products that can increase the total addressable market of the company and leverage the scalable
        nature of software to bring significant value.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>In software, distribution is important since the marginal cost is zero. Since many users interact with Spotify on a daily basis, Spotify is able to directly promote new initiatives to users. Over the last year, Spotify already gained significant traction
        in podcasts. Compared to new podcast startups such as Breaker, Spotify has the advantage to push podcasts onto all of its large base of music listeners.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Spotify has a great brand image, and it is known for creating the best user experience.&nbsp;Taking a long term view, the company has great potential upside to play a larger role in the music industry and other audio formats as well (hardware, audiobook,
        podcast subscription platform…)<br></p>
    <p>In the short/medium term, the main two points of my bull case on Spotify are: (1) strong market position in a sticky subscription business and (2) podcast opportunity to drive subscription and ads<br></p>
    <p>(1) Strong market position in music streaming, upside in margins<br>The music industry started out dominated by physical sales, but then moved toward digital downloads, and now paid subscription has grown rapidly over the last 10 years and took over
        as the largest segment of the market. There does not seem to be a clear next step in evolution. Streaming can be seen as the “end-state” of music consumption for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Spotify is the largest music streaming platform in terms of MAUs (299M in total, and 138M Premium subs). It aggregated demand, meaning that music labels need it just as it needs the labels.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Music streaming is a very sticky business where people do not hop between platforms because they build personal playlists and get familiar with the interface. People who are subscribed to Spotify longer are also less likely to churn (similar to the
        Lindy effect).&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Strategic initiatives such as bundling with Hulu to attract college students may be less profitable now, but all works towards larger ARPU, larger margin because these users can be very sticky and pay the standard rate of subscription in the future.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>There are also a few opportunities for Spotify to increase its margin of music in the future.&nbsp;<br>1. Spotify hasn't raised prices ($9.99) since its US launch in 2011.&nbsp;<br>2. Up-sell with higher quality streaming at higher monthly prices
        (Tidal charges $20 for Hifi)<br>3. Help artists create a stronger connection with their fanbase through ads and digital experiences (2-sided marketplace).<br></p>
    <p>(2) Podcast opportunity<br>Podcast listening is growing at 25% yoy. A quarter of Americans now listen to podcasts daily, and 65% of monthly podcast listeners have been listening for less than 3 years (<a href="https://a16z.com/2019/05/23/podcast-ecosystem-investing-2019/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Source</span></a>).
        There is a lot of value-add to consumers but podcasts aren't monetized well. The podcast industry generated $679 mm advertising revenue in 2019, compared to $18 bn in radio ad spend.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Similar to transition from linear programming to over-the-top in TV ad sales (Roku’s growth driver), we can expect ad spend to shift, and streaming to take a larger share of the audio advertising market in the next 5-10 years.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Podcast apps are a fragmented market because many smaller apps compete on user-facing features but deliver the same content. Spotify, leveraging its existing user base and acquisition of exclusive content, is in a great position to consolidate the
        market and eat into Apple Podcasts’ market share. Because Spotify already occupies great real estate on people’s phones, it offers an attractive value proposition to consolidate all their audio usage in one app.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Spotify’s entrance into podcasts can lead to further monetization on the ad-supported segment, which currently only contributes 10% of total revenue. Since users who listen to podcasts spend 2x time on Spotify, there are more opportunities for ad
        placement.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>Spotify also created moats through licensing deals with Bill Simons, Joe Rogan, Michelle Obama and more, and thereby limited competition from new entrants and created product differentiation, which works to boost premium subscription.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>With no plans to monetize from Apple Podcasts, Spotify is the winner to capture the increase in listenership and ad spend on podcasts.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p><strong>Competition:&nbsp;</strong><br>-Spotify has a social component, where you can see what your friends are listening to. Since Spotify is already the largest streaming service, there is a level of network effect absent in the competitors.&nbsp;<br>-Apple
        and Amazon, being big tech companies, currently face strong antitrust pressures that would cause unwanted scrutiny if they were to aggressively acquire content for their platforms.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p><strong>Risks:</strong><br>-Increased competition from Apple, Amazon, Google:<br>Apple bundle with better value can cause churn in Spotify subscribers (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bloomberg</span></a>)<br></p>
